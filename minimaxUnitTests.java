	 * (e.g., http://ggpserver. general-game-playing.de/ggpserver/public/view_game.jsp?name=tictactoe),
	 * figure out the best move in certain states and write unit tests that checks if your player actually
	 *  finds the same moves. Don’t forget that your player may play different roles in the game
	 *  (not always the first one)! Don’t forget to test games with different numbers of roles,
	 *  games with and without simultaneous moves, etc.*/
