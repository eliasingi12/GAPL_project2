	/* Implement Minimax search and play the best move found.
	 * You should use iterative deepening, otherwise dealing with the time constraints becomes hard.
	 * The Gamer class you created has a method getCurrentState() to get the current state of the game
	 * and getStateMachine() to get a state machine representing the game.
	 * This state machine can be used to get legal moves, compute successor states, ...,
	 * that you will need to implement the search.*/
